  // like_template below.
  string pattern = 2;

  // The template used to generate a LIKE expression on test names
  // that defines the test name cluster identified by this rule.
  //
  // This like expression has two purposes:
  // (1) If the test name cluster is large enough to justify the
  //     creation of a bug cluster, the like expression is used to
  //     generate a failure association rule of the following form:
  //        test LIKE "<evaluated like_template>"
  // (2) A hash of the expression is used as the clustering key for the
  //     test name-based suggested cluster. This generally has the desired
  //     clustering behaviour, i.e. the parts of the test name which
  //     are important enough to included in the LIKE expression for (1)
  //     are also those on which clustering should occur.
  //
  // As is usual for LIKE expressions, the template can contain
  // the following operators to do wildcard matching:
  // * '%' for wildcard match of an arbitrary number of characters, and
  // * '_' for single character wildcard match.
  //
  // To match literal '%' or '_', escape the operator with a '\',
  // i.e. use "\%" or "\_" to match literal '%' and '_' respectively.
  // To match literal '\', you should use "\\".
  //
  // The template can refer to parts of the test name matched by
  // the rule pattern using ${name}, where name refers to the capture
  // group (see pattern). To insert the literal '$', the sequence '$$'
  // should be used.
  //
  // Example.
  //   Assume our project uploads google test (gtest) results with the test
  //   name prefix "gtest://". Further assume we used the pattern:
  //     "^gtest://(\w+/)?(?P<testcase>\w+\.\w+)/\w+$"
  //
  //   We might use the following like_template:
  //     "gtest://%${testcase}%"
  //
  //   When instantiated for a value-parameterised test, e.g.
  //   "gtest://InstantiationOne/ColorSpaceTest.testNullTransform/0",
  //   the result would be a failure association rule like:
  //     test LIKE "gtest://%ColorSpaceTest.testNullTransform%"
  //
  //   Note the use of ${testcase} to refer to the testname capture group
  //   specified in the pattern example.
  //
  //   See https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#how-to-write-value-parameterized-tests
  //   to understand value-parameterised google tests.
  //
  // It is known that not all clusters can be precisely matched by
  // a LIKE expression. Nonetheless, LUCI Analysis prefers LIKE expressions
  // as they are easier to comprehend and modify by users, and in
  // most cases, the added precision is not required.
  //
  // As such, your rule should try to ensure the generated LIKE statement
  // captures your clustering logic as best it can. Your LIKE expression
  // MUST match all test names matched by your regex pattern, and MAY
  // capture additional test names (though this is preferably minimised,
  // to reduce differences between the suggested clusters and eventual
  // bug clusters).
