-- This script initializes a LUCI Analysis Spanner database.

-- FailureAssociationRules associate failures with bugs. When a rule
-- is used to match incoming test failures, the resultant cluster is
-- known as a 'bug cluster' because the failures in it are associated
-- with a bug (via the failure association rule).
-- The ID of a bug cluster corresponding to a rule is
-- (Project, RuleBasedClusteringAlgorithm, RuleID), where
-- RuleBasedClusteringAlgorithm is the algorithm name of the algorithm
-- that clusters failures based on failure association rules (e.g.
-- 'rules-v2'), and (Project, RuleId) is the ID of the rule.
CREATE TABLE FailureAssociationRules (

  -- in future, if it is needed for performance.
