// BotSession carries an RBE bot session ID and the latest validated PollState.

//
// It serves two purposes:
//   1. Protect the RBE bot session ID from tampering by the bot (e.g. prevents
//      the bot from using a different bot session ID of a bot in another pool).
//   2. Preserve parameters of the last known PollState (in particular auth
//      ones) and bind the session ID to them, so even if the bot has a valid
//      BotSession token from another bot, it won't be able to use them (because
//      it will fail the auth check encoded in the PollState).

// Python server. When running a long task, the bot is not polling anything and
// can't refresh the PollState token. But it still periodically calls
// UpdateBotSession to send heartbeats to RBE. This is where PollState stored in
// BotSession token is verified and where BotSession token is occasionally
// refreshed.
//
// If a call to UpdateBotSession has both the PollState token and BotSession
// token (happens when a bot is polling new tasks from RBE), the information in
// the PollState token is used as authoritative since PollState tokens are
// generated by Python code based on the freshest state of bot configs.
