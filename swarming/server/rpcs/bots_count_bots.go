	// avoid double counting entities that match multiple subqueries at the same
	// time. In that case we will need to manually run multiple keys-only regular
	// queries and merge their results locally (by counting only unique keys).
	//
	// Note that it is tempting to run a single projection query on `composite`
	// repeated field and group bots by state locally (since we need to visit them
	// all anyway to count the total number of bots). But such query surprisingly
	// returns 4x results: one entity per individual value of `composite` field
	// (and not one entity with 4 values in repeated `composite` field as one
	// would expect). So such query is actually ~4x slower in terms of wall clock

	// below).

	// a consistent snapshot of the state, since otherwise it can drift quite a
	// bit between individual queries. This appears to have no noticeable impact
	// on performance in production (the queries are equally slow either way).
	//
	// If we are going to use aggregation queries, run them non-transactionally,
	// since they are not supported in transactions. They are usually super fast
	// (under a second, even when counting a lot of bots) and the state doesn't
	// change much during such a short interval. We can tolerate "eventual
	// consistency" for such huge performance wins. Swarming CountBots API never
	// promised to be strongly consistent anyway (and never was before).
