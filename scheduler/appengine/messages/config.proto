  //     finishing invocation before starting a new one. Overruns are not

//   * a ref has just been created.
//
// LIMITATIONS:
//
//  1. Per each fast-forward ref's tip change as observed by scheduler,
//     no more than 50 latest (according to gitiles default ordering) commits
//     will result in emitted triggers.
//     This is a safeguard against mistaken or deliberate but unusual git push
//     actions, which typically don't have intent of triggering a build for each
//     such commit.
//     If you absolutely need to act on every new commit even in such cases,
//     you will need to roll your own implementation, though you may still find
//     Scheduler GitilesTask useful to trigger your code on new changes.
//
//  2. No hard latency guarantee. A single invocation of GitilesTask may not be
//     able to process all the backlog. This is particularly true after a config
//     change changes the set of watched ref. However, GitilesTask is designed
//     to make continuous progress with each invocation.

  //     "regexp:refs/heads/[^/]+" or "regexp:refs/branch-heads/\d+\.\d+", but
  //     the regular expression should have a literal prefix with at least two
  //     slashes present, e.g. "refs/release-\d+/foobar" is not allowed, because
  //     the literal prefix "refs/release-" contains only one slash. The regexp
  //     should not start with ^ or end with $ as they will be added
  //     automatically.

  // expressions limiting emitted triggers only to commits whose tree diff
  // touches relevant files.
  //

  // emits triggers for any commit.
  // Specifying just path_regexps_exclude is not allowed.
  //
  // path_regexps and path_regexps_exclude rules apply on each individual commit
  // independently. For each commit, a set of all filepaths referenced in Git
  // commit diff is used for matching.  On top of simple file additions and file
  // modifictions, this also includes: file removals, file moves (old and new
  // path considered), and changing of file metadata (e.g., chmod +x). This
  // doesn't include directories (git doesn't track them explicitly).
  //
  // Triggers are emitted for a commit if only if at least 1 touched filepath
  //  1. is not matched by any path_regexps_exclude,
  //  2. AND is matched at least 1 path_regexps
  // **subject to caveats below** for exceptional cases.
  //
  // Each path_regexps and path_regexps_exclude is a regular expression
  // "a/b/c/.+". It should not start with ^ or end with $ as they will be added
  // automatically.
  //
  // CAVEATS:
  //  1. path_regexps: ".+"
  //     will NOT match commits which modify no files (aka empty commits) and
  //     as such differs from default case of not specifying any `path_regexps`.
  //  2. Per GitilesTask doc, if a ref fast-forwards >50 commits, only last 50
  //     commits are checked. If none of them matches any path specified here, a
  //     single trigger is emitted for the ref's new tip.
  //     Rational: it's better to emit redundant triggers than silently not emit
  //     triggers for commits beyond latest 50.
  //     TODO(tandrii): it's possible to improve this by examining diff
  //     between ref's last and new tips, but one has to worry about gitiles
  //     taking potentially very long time to compute it.
