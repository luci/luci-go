# CIPD (Chrome Infrastructure Package Deployment)

CIPD is package deployment infrastructure. It consists of a
[package registry][cipd-service] and a [CLI client][cipd-client] to
create/upload/download/install packages.

A CIPD package has a package name (e.g. infra/tools/foo) and a list of
content-addressed instances (e.g. bec8e88201949be06b06174178c2f62b81e4008e),
where slashes in package names form a hierarchy of packages and an instance is
a ZIP file with package file contents.

CIPD is different from apt-get, brew, nuget, pip, npm, etc is that it is not
tied to a specific OS or language. It is achieved by keeping it simple.

The package registry is implemented in Python and the [source code][cipd-service]
is in infra.git repository.

## Versions

A package instance can be referenced by a tuple (package name, version), for
example when installing a package.
A version can be one of

*   an instance id which is a hash of the instance file contents, e.g.
    "bec8e88201949be06b06174178c2f62b81e4008e"
*   a tag, e.g. "git_revision:deadbeef", if it is unique
    among all instances of the package. Read more about tags below.
*   a ref, e.g. "latest", see below.

### Tags

A package instance can be marked with tags, where a tag is a colon-separated
key-value pair, e.g. "git_revision:deadbeef".
If some tag points to only one instance, such tag can be used as version
identifier.

### Refs

A package can have git-like refs, where a ref of a package points to one of the
instances of the package by id. For example, chrome-infra continuous builders
always update "latest" ref of a package to the instance that they upload.

## Platforms

If a package is platform-specific, the package name should have `/<os>-<arch>`
suffix where `os` can be `linux`, `mac` or `windows` and arch can be `386`,
`amd64` or `armv6l`. For example, `infra/tools/cipd/linux-amd64`. See
[the ensure package docs][client/cipd/ensure/doc.go] for os and arch values.

Some [cipd-client] subcomands accept a package name "directory" that ends with
slash, e.g. "infra/tools/cipd/", and apply a change to all packages in that
directory (non-recursively).

## Access control

A package directory can have an ACL that applies to packages in that
directory and inherited by subdirectories. ACLs can be read/controlled by the
[cipd-client].
