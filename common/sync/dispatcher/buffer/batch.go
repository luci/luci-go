// Batch represents a collection of individual work items and associated
// metadata.
//
// Batches are are cut by the Channel according to Options.Buffer, and can be
// manipulated by ErrorFn and SendFn.
//
// ErrorFn and SendFn may manipulate the contents of the Batch (Data and Meta)
// to do things such as:
//   - Associate a UID with the Batch (e.g. in the Meta field) to identify it to
//     remote services for deduplication.
//   - Remove already-processed items from Data in case the SendFn partially
//     succeeded.
//
// The dispatcher accounts for the number of work items in the Batch as it
// leases the Batch out; initially the Batch's length will be len(Data). If the
// SendFn reduces the length of Data before the NACK, the accounted number of
// work items will be accordingly reduced. The accounted length can never grow
// (i.e. extending Data doesn't do anything).
//
// Similarly, if the buffer is configured with BatchSize, the accounted Size of
// the batch is defined as the sum of the cached sizes in Data. Reducing this
// amount (by removing items, or potentially reducing the Size in a BatchItem)
// will reduce the effective Size of this Batch, but adding to Data cannot
// increase the Size of the batch.
