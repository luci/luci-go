# LUCI UI
LUCI UI is a single UI for all of LUCI, including specialized UIs that may only
apply to a single LUCI project

If you want to build a new LUCI related UI project, LUCI UI is a great
place to kick start your project. Check out the
[LUCI UI contribution guide](http://go/luci-ui-contribution) for a list of
things LUCI UI has to offer!

If you need help on LUCI UI development, check out this growing
[list](./docs) of documentation. Also feel free to contact us at
chops-luci-test@google.com!

<mark>It's highly recommended to scan through the list of guides in
[./docs/guides/index.md](./docs/guides/index.md) first to see what are available
there.</mark> This will be helpful even if you are a seasoned React developer
(you likely won't see similar guides elsewhere).

Those guides help you
 * accomplish common UI development tasks in a way that is (usually) enabled by
   by custom designed modules in the LUCI UI stack.
 * solve UI development issues that are specific to LUCI UI.
