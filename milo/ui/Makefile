# Comapring to `up-dev`, this is much faster because it only deploys the default
# service and does not run `npm ci` (which means you need to ensure the
# dependencies are installed).
# It also overrides the Milo host when deploying the default service only for UI
# demo so the UI does not talk to the demo version of the Milo API service which
# may not exist.
