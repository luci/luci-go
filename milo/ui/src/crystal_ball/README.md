This directory contains the front-end components and routing for the Crystal
Ball integration within LUCI UI. Crystal Ball is a system for visualizing
performance metric data, primarily focused on Android.

See the design document for more details:

The components and pages within this module are responsible for fetching and
displaying performance metrics.
