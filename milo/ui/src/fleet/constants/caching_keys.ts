// We define a custom key that is used to allow specific queries to opt into
// IndexedDB caching through useQuery. This is used by use cases like caching
// our DeviceDimensions data.
// IndexedDB caching enables us to show data to users faster on initial page
// load but runs into risks like increased deserialization time and introducing
// caching related edge cases, so we want to opt-in specific queries where
// the extra benefits might be worth the increased code complexity and risk.
