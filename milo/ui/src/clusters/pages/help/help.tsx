          <Typography paragraph>
            We recommend associating failures with bugs using{' '}
            <em>failure reasons</em> instead of <em>tests</em>, if possible.
            This is for two reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Associating failures to bugs using <em>tests</em> usually leads
                to bugs that are more difficult to manage, as the tests can fail
                for multiple different reasons, and tracking the investigation
                of multiple reasons in one bug is hard.
              </li>
              <li>
                Multiple tests may be failing with the same failure reason, and
                maintaining one canoncial bug for that reason can avoid
                duplicating investigation work.

            Yes! Just merge the bugs in the issue tracker, as you would
            normally. LUCI Analysis will automatically combine the failure
            association rules when the next bug filing pass runs (every 15
            minutes or so).

            <strong>Take care:</strong> Just because some of the failures of one
            bug are the same as another, it does not mean all failures are. We
            generally recommend defining bugs based on <em>failure reason</em>{' '}
            of the failure (i.e.{' '}
            <em>reason LIKE &quot;%Check failed: Expected foo, got %&quot;</em>
            ), if possible. See{' '}

            If the failures can be distinguished using the{' '}

            If the failures <strong>cannot</strong> be distinguished based on
            the <em>failure reason</em>&nbsp; or <em>test</em>, it is not
            possible to represent this split in LUCI Analysis. In this case, we
            recommend using the bug linked from LUCI Analysis as the parent bug
            to track all failures of the test, and using seperate (child) bugs
            to track the investigation of individual issues.

            How does LUCI Analysis determine which component(s) to assign to an

        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography paragraph>
            When LUCI Analysis auto-files a bug for a cluster, it assigns it to
            all components which contribute at least 30% of the cluster&apos;s
            test failures.

          <Typography paragraph>
            In chromium projects, the component associated with a test failure
            is controlled by&nbsp;
            <Link
              href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/HEAD/go/src/infra/tools/dirmd/README.md"

            >
              DIR_METADATA
            </Link>
            &nbsp;files in the directory hierarchy of the test. The component
            associated with a specific test failure can be validated by viewing
            the failure in LUCI UI (ci.chromium.org), and looking for the
            monorail_component tag.
          </Typography>
          <img
            src={monorailComponentImageUrl}
            alt="Monorail component is the component that test matches, it appears in LUCI UI in the test variant tags."
          />
          <Typography paragraph>
            If a failure does not have this tag, it means the test result
            uploader is not providing component information for the test.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            In most cases, bugs being assigned to the wrong component can be
            fixed by updating the DIR_METADATA for the test.
