/**
 * @fileoverview
 *
 * This is the rollup config to build assets that needs to be served at `/`
 * (instead of `/ui/`).
 *
 * Vite doesn't like index.html to be placed anywhere other than at the
 * root level of the input/output directory.
 * Vite doesn't allow us to output any asset to a place outside of the
 * defined output directory.
 * We want to place some assets (e.g. `root_sw.js`) in the parent directory of
 * Vite's output directory because that closely matches how those files are
 * served.
 *
 * As a result, we need to output Vite generated assets to `dist/ui` and use a
 * a separate built step for other assets placed under `dist/`.
