# Generic Libraries

This directory documents the generic libraries available in
`milo/ui/src/generic_libs`. These libraries are designed to be reusable across
different parts of the Milo UI and potentially other LUCI UI projects.

## Categories

*   [**Components**](./components/index.md): UI components for common patterns
    like routing, editing, layout, and analytics.
*   [**Hooks**](./hooks/index.md): React hooks for data fetching, state
    management, and utilities.
*   [**Tools**](./tools/index.md): Utility functions, classes, and helpers for
    pRPC, async operations, and more.

## Types

Common types used across these libraries can be found in
`milo/ui/src/generic_libs/types.ts`.
