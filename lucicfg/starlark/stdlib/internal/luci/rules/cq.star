    """Defines optional configuration of the CQ service for this project.

    CQ is a service that monitors Gerrit CLs in a configured set of Gerrit
    projects, and launches tryjobs (which run pre-submit tests etc.) whenever a
    CL is marked as ready for CQ, and submits the CL if it passes all checks.

    **NOTE**: before adding a new luci.cq(...), visit and follow instructions
    at http://go/luci/cv/gerrit-pubsub to ensure that pub/sub integration is
    enabled for all the Gerrit projects.

    This optional rule can be used to set global CQ parameters that apply to all
    luci.cq_group(...) defined in the project.

    Args:
      ctx: the implicit rule context, see lucicfg.rule(...).
      submit_max_burst: maximum number of successful CQ attempts completed by
        submitting corresponding Gerrit CL(s) before waiting
        `submit_burst_delay`. This feature today applies to all attempts
        processed by CQ, across all luci.cq_group(...) instances. Optional, by
        default there's no limit. If used, requires `submit_burst_delay` to be
        set too.
      submit_burst_delay: how long to wait between bursts of submissions of CQ
        attempts. Required if `submit_max_burst` is used.
      draining_start_time: **Temporarily not supported, see
        https://crbug.com/1208569. Reach out to LUCI team oncall if you need
        urgent help.**. If present, the CQ will refrain from processing any CLs,
        on which CQ was triggered after the specified time. This is an UTC
        RFC3339 string representing the time, e.g. `2017-12-23T15:47:58Z` and Z
        is mandatory.
      status_host: Optional. Decide whether user has access to the details of
        runs in this Project in LUCI CV UI. Currently, only the following
        hosts are accepted: 1) "chromium-cq-status.appspot.com" where everyone
        can access run details. 2) "internal-cq-status.appspot.com" where only
        Googlers can access run details. Please don't use the public host if
        the Project launches internal builders for public repos. It can leak
        the builder names, which may be confidential.
      honor_gerrit_linked_accounts: Optional. Decide whether LUCI CV should
        consider the primary gerrit accounts and the linked/secondary accounts
        sharing the same permission. That means if the primary account is
        allowed to trigger CQ dry run, the secondary account will also be
        allowed, vice versa.
      gerrit_listener_type: Optional. Decide the type of listener for Gerrit CL
        creation/update event. Default to cq.GERRIT_LISTENER_TYPE_PUBSUB
        if not specified. The project should set up pub/sub subscription for
        all Gerrit host it is watching if pubsub listener is used.
        See go/luci/cv/gerrit-pubsub.
