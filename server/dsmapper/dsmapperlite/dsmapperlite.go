// Package dsmapperlite implements an in-process datastore mapper.
//
// Unlike its bigger sibling dsmapper, it doesn't distribute mapping
// operations across machines, but in exchange has a very simple API. There's
// no need to install it as a server module or setup task queue tasks etc. Just
// use is a library.
//
// Useful for quickly visiting up to 100K entities.

// Map passes all entities matching the query to the callback, in parallel,
// in some random order.
//
// Runs up to `shards` number of parallel goroutines, where each one executes
// a datastore query and passes the resulting entities to the callback (along
// with the shard index). Each query fetches entities in `batchSize` pages
// before handling them. The overall memory consumption is thus
// `O(shards * batchSize * averageEntitySize)`.
//
// Within a shard, the callback is called sequentially, but different shards
// are processed in parallel. If the callback needs to parallelize entity
// processing more, it should manage its own goroutine pool and pass entities
// to it.
//
// If the callback returns an error, Map aborts the entire operation ASAP (but
// it may take some time to wind down). When this happens, the context passed
// to the callback is canceled. This context is also canceled once the mapping
// is done. If the callback wants to run some operations asynchronously, it
// needs to use another context (e.g. the context passed to Map).
