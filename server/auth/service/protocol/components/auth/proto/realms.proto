// Permission is a symbol that has form "<service>.<subject>.<verb>", which
// describes some elementary action ("<verb>") that can be done to some category
// of resources ("<subject>"), managed by some particular kind of LUCI service
// ("<service>").
//
// Within each individual realm (see Realm message), a principal (such as an end
// user or a service account) can have zero or more permissions that describe
// what this user can actually do to resources belonging to the realm. See Realm
// message for the definition of what "belonging to the realm" means.
//
// Examples of permissions:
//   * buildbucket.build.create
//   * swarming.pool.listBots
//   * swarming.task.cancel
//
// Note that permission names are composed of generic terms, not some specific
// IDs of service deployments or resources. Generally, using a concrete
// permission name in the service's source code as a constant should look
// natural.
//
// A permission can be marked as "internal". Internal permissions are not
// allowed to appear in custom roles in user-defined project realms.cfg files.
// They can be used in internal realms (defined in realms.cfg in the LUCI Auth
// service config set, see comments for Realm message) and they are added to
// some predefined roles by the LUCI Auth service itself. They are used to setup
// ACLs for internal interactions between LUCI components.
//
// Each individual LUCI service should document what permissions it checks and
// when. It becomes a part of service's public API. Usually services should
// check only permissions of resources they own (e.g. "<service>.<subject>.*"),
// but in exceptional cases they may also check permissions intended for other
// services. This is primarily useful for services that somehow "proxy" access
// to resources.
//
// Field `permissions` in Realms message describes all permissions known to the
// LUCI Auth service. The LUCI Auth service guarantees that all permissions
// mentioned in all realms (in `realms` field) are among `permissions` set.
//
// If a LUCI service checks a permission that is no longer (or not yet) listed
// in the `permissions` set, the check should succeed with "no permission"
// result, and produce a warning in service's logs.

// library a string-valued dictionary of attributes that describe the context
// of the permission check. It may contain things like the name of the resource
// being accessed, or parameters of the incoming RPC request that triggered
// the check.
//
// A list of available attributes and meaning of their values depends on
// the permission being checked and the service should document it in its API
// documentation.

// Realm is a named collection of (<principal>, <permission>) pairs.
//
// Realms are primarily defined in realms.cfg project config files. Such realms
// are called project realms. They are controlled by respective **project**
// owners and used to define ACLs for resources owned by these projects.
//
// There's a special set of realms (called internal realms or, sometimes, global
// realms) that are defined in realms.cfg in the LUCI Auth service config set.
// They are controlled by LUCI **deployment** owners and used to define ACLs for
// resources that are associated with LUCI deployment or LUCI services (and do
// not belong to any particular LUCI project). They are also allowed to use
// internal roles and permissions to define administrative-level ACLs (i.e. ACLs
// that transcend project boundaries).
//
// A full realm name has form "<project>:<realm>", where:
//   * "<project>" is a name of the LUCI project that defined the realm or
//     literal "@internal" for internal realms.
//   * "<realm>" is a name of the realm from a realms.cfg config file. This name
//     is also known as a project-scoped name, since it makes sense only within
//     a scope of some concrete LUCI project.
//
// A LUCI resource can point to exactly one realm by referring to its full
// "<project>:<realm>" name. Such reference can either be calculated on the fly
// from other resource's properties, or be stored alongside the resource's data.
// We say that such resource "belongs to the realm" or "lives in the realm" or
// is just "in the realm". We also say that such resource belongs to the project
// "<project>". The corresponding Realm message then describes who can do what
// to the resource.
//
// The logic of how resources get assigned to realms is a part of the public API
// of the service that owns resources. Some services may use a static realm
// assignment via project configuration files, others may do it dynamically by
// accepting a realm when a resource is created via an RPC.
//
// There are three special realms (all optional) that a project can have:
// "<project>:@root", "<project>:@legacy" and "<project>:@project".
//
// The root realm should be used as a fallback when an existing resource points
// to a realm that doesn't exist. Without the root realm, such resources become
// effectively inaccessible and this may be undesirable. The root realm usually
// contains only administrative-level bindings.
//
// The legacy realm should be used for legacy resources created before the
// realms mechanism was introduced in case the service can't figure out a more
// appropriate realm based on resource's properties. The service must clearly
// document when and how it uses the legacy realm (if it uses it at all).
//
// The project realm should be used as the realm for 'project global' resources,
// for example, the project configuration itself, or derivations thereof. Some
// LUCI services may use bindings in this realm to allow federation of
// administration responsibilities to the project (rather than relying on
// exclusively LUCI service administrators).
//
// The actual list of (<principal>, <permission>) pairs is defined via a list of
// bindings, where each binding basically says "all these principals have all
// these permissions". In other words, each binding defines some subset of
// permissions and the overall realm permissions is a union of all such subsets.
// Subsets defined by bindings may potentially intersect or be empty.
//
// The LUCI Auth service constructs bindings by interpreting realms.cfg files
// using some set of rules. Individual LUCI services **must not care** about
// what these rules really are. They should use only the end result (in the form
// of bindings) provided in the Realm message. This allows to decouple the
// high-level user-facing language for defining permissions from the
// implementation of each individual LUCI service that checks permissions.
//
// A realm can also carry some small amount of data (usually auth related) that
// LUCI services use when dealing with this realm. It should be something that
// all (or at least more than one) LUCI services use. Configuration specific to
// a single service should be in this service's project config instead.
