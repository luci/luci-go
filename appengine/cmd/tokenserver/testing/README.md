# The token server <-> client semi-manual integration test

This test sets up and configures local instance of the token server and tests
that clients are able to use it.

Prerequisites:

* Some Cloud Project that will host service account. You must be its Editor,
  and Cloud IAM API must be enabled.
* [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) tool, with you authenticated
  (via `gcloud init`). It magically enables GAE dev server to use real OAuth
  tokens (belonging to your account) when making URL fetch calls (in particular
  to Cloud IAM).
* `$GOROOT` and `$GOPATH` properly configured, `$GOBIN` in `$PATH`.
* `openssl` tool available in `$PATH`.
* `gae.py` tool available in `$PATH`.

How to run the test:

1. Open a terminal tab, run `devserver.sh`. It will start the token server.
1. In another tab run `clrserver.sh`. It will start a server that serves CRLs.
1. Finally, in the main tab run `run_test.sh` to execute the actual test.

Keeping other two services in separate tabs is helpful for two reasons:

* You can investigate the state of the server using RPC explorer in the browser.
* Starting and killing background devappserver in a script is surprisingly
  difficult task. `Ctrl+C` in a tab seems to do the trick more reliably.
