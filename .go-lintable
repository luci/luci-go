# This file defines directories that should have .golangci.yaml in them.
#
# See scripts/regen_golangci_config.py for the format of this file and for
# details of how it is parsed. Basically it is a list of sections. Each section
# defines a template to use for generating .golangci.yaml and a list of
# directory paths. regen_golangci_config.py script will use the template name to
# figure out how to generate .golangci.yaml and place each such generated file
# into every given path.
#
# Each directory in the repository that contains *.go files should be covered
# by exactly one generated .golangci.yaml. Otherwise `golangci-lint` may get
# confused and use a wrong config. The script will check that.

# Miscellaneous packages that contain collections of unrelated things. Their
# local imports are not grouped together (since it makes little sense to group
