// A key-value map describing one variant of a module.
//
// A module can be executed in different ways, for example on
// different OS, GPUs, with different compile options or runtime flags.
// A variant definition captures one such variant.
// A test case with a specific variant definition is called test variant.
//
// Guidelines for variant definition design:
// - This rule guides what keys MUST be present in the definition.
//   A single expected result of a given test variant is enough to consider it
//   passing (potentially flakily). If it is important to differentiate across
//   a certain dimension (e.g. whether web tests are executed with or without
//   site per process isolation), then there MUST be a key that captures the
//   dimension (e.g. a name from test_suites.pyl).
//   Otherwise, a pass in one variant will hide a failure of another one.
//
// - This rule guides what keys MUST NOT be present in the definition.
//   A change in the key-value set essentially resets the test result history.
//   For example, if GN args are among variant key-value pairs, then adding a
//   new GN arg changes the identity of the test variant and resets its history.
//
// In Chromium, variant keys are:
// - bucket: the LUCI bucket, e.g. "ci"
// - builder: the LUCI builder, e.g. "linux-rel"
// - test_suite: a name from
//   https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/testing/buildbot/test_suites.pyl

  // refers to sub-file granularity unless no such granularity exists.
  //
  // Application guidance:
  // * Standard usage: E.g. GTest methods, JUnit methods, etc.
  //
  //   Put the test method name in this field, escaping any colons (':')
  //   and backlashes ('\') with a backslash '\'.
  //   If your tests have additional hierarchy in the test case name,
  //   consider the section on 'Extended depth hierarchies' below.
  //
  // * Class/package-level setup/teardown:
  //
  //   Use the special value "*fixture" when reporting the result of
  //   setup and teardown common to tests in the same fine_name.
  //
  // * Extended depth hierarchies:
  //
  //   When uploading a test case from an extended depth hierarchy, use the separator ':'
  //   to separate the components of the test case identifier (e.g. the describe blocks
  //   in a jest/mocha test). Text between the separators must have all occurrences
  //   of ':' and '\' escaped with a backslash ('\') to avoid other colons being interpreted
  //   as separators. Each component of such a hierarchical test case ID must not be empty.
  //   E.g. 'topLevelTest:' is not valid.
  //
  //   Rationale and Important Caveats
  //
  //   Most test hierarchy should be captured by the module, coarse and fine names.
  //   For example, the module typically captures the compilation unit, the coarse name
  //   the directory (e.g. package name) and the fine name the file (e.g. class name).
  //   This leaves the case name to capture sub-file granularity, which
  //   in many frameworks is simply the method name.
  //
  //   However, some frameworks have additional levels of test hierarchy within the
  //   "file" level. For example, Jest and Mocha allow tests to be nested within
  //   an arbitrary number of describe('subscope', func() { ... }) blocks. There may
  //   also be parameterisations of tests. For such cases, we offer a standardised
  //   way to express the additional hierarchy using colons (':') to separate components.
  //   UI may give special treatment to components so expressed in future.
  //
  //   Only consider uploading separate results for each test in such an additional
  //   depth hierarchy if all of the following hold:
  //   - Passes are reported for each test, not just failures.
  //   - Tests are independent (e.g. a assertion failure does not cause multiple
  //     failing results, e.g. failure of the child test does not also cause the
  //     parent to fail or vice-versa as is typical in many 'subtest' arrangements).
  //   - In case of retries, you are happy for each test passing individually at least
  //     once to allow CL submission. I.E. they do not all have to pass in the same run.
  //
  //   The above criteria are important to keep the test results view understandable in
  //   case of retries, and to protect the data model that downstream clients
  //   rely on (e.g. clients must report passes where they report failures).
  //
  //   If they cannot be met, do not upload separate tests results and prefer to upload one
  //   test result per top-level method. Currently Mocha and Jest tests, and parameterised
  //   GTest methods are the only cases where it is known these requirements can be met. Python
  //   unittests and go subtests do not meet the requirements due to falling foul of the
  //   independence requirement (and in case of python unittests, also the inability to
  //   report passes for subtests).
  //
  // Constraints:
  // - Must not start with one of the characters in [ !"#$%'()*+,] (i.e. U+0020 to U+002C),
  //   unless it is to write the value "*fixture".
  // - The use of the ':' character is reserved for denoting variable depth/extended depth
  //   hierarchies. If you do not intend this semantic, you must escape it using a backslash.
  //   (You must also escape all backslashes that are not denoting an escape sequence with
  //   a backslash.)
  // - When the case_name is broken up by ':', each such component must be non-empty.
  // - Limited to 512 bytes of printable UTF-8. For the purposes of this
  //   definition, the unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) is not considered printable.
  //   See also length limits on `TestIdentifier` as a whole.
  // - All unicode must be in Normalization Form C.
  // - Use of spaces is allowed, but discouraged.
  // - Legacy test identifiers (in module "legacy") are exempted from some of the
  //   above constraints to facilitate backwards compatibility but use of this quirk is
  //   discouraged.
